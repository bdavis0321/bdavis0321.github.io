  <h1>The Origin</h1>
  <p>"After meeting in the Cottage Farm Historical District 
    Advanced Technical Bowling League (CFHDATBL), 
    the members realized they had REAL talent, and quickly began using their 
    penchant for earworms and fascinating melodies. 
    After being endorsed by Richard D. James, 
    they were given 10 Nillion dollars to fund their calling."

<h3>Mr. Meanor</h3>
<p>Hailing from rural Connecticut, 
    Michael “Mister” Meanor, prides themselves on their 
    deep and supple understanding of the cosmic meta. 
    Having gone to Oxford University for a couple months 
    before mysteriously disappearing, they were found by the 
    Cottage Farm Historical District Advanced Technical Bowling League 
    and quickly taken in for their talents. It is not known how 
    they began their musicianship, but it is clear that the 
    Pryda Snare became their true calling. Using incredibly 
    complicated sound design and electronic performance 
    techniques, “Mr. Meanor” puts on a show to be remembered.

    <h3>Meet Father Thomas</h3>
    <p>Father Thomas, a Malibu native, is well-renowned for his soaring soprano range and facility. He joined the group in 2017 for their Chant-pionship win at the 1252th annual Chant-off where the group chanted for record 30 hours straight. In addition to chanting, Father Thomas also enjoys a good yodel, and got his undergraduate degree in polyphonic yodeling from NYU in 2016.</p>

    <h3>Meet Father Noah</h3>
      <p>Father Noah is a native to Finland, currently residing in Rome.
      Father Noah found his calling during the 10th century
      when the pope gave a decree that gregorian chanters
      would be paid a fair living wage and given respectable royalties on all chants!
      Despite the advent of the influential politician spotifius maximus, Father Noah
      has been a strong leader at the center of equal opportunity for gregorian chanters.
      Some of father Noah's favorite hobbies are taking care of the garden at the local
      monastery, going for long walks on the tiber river, and painting natural landscapes.
