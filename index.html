  <h1>Who We Are</h1>
  <p>"The 4rd Explorer are a next generation indie post-nightcore bedroom-dreamgaze arena rock band
    making waves in the northeastern Cottage Farm Historic District scene.

    Telluryde. (shoutout Bejalvin) They are currently recording their 4rd “studio” “album,” “The 5st Exploration.” 
    After releasing the RIAA certified, quadruple-Cobalt single “Our Song,” they began touring in 
    prestigious venues such as EDC, Denny’s, my basement, First Avenue, Bryce’s basement, and Madison Square Garden."

<p>“Mr. Meanor” (Pryda Snare)</p>
<p>Brain Johnson (Microphone)</p>

    </p>
  <h1>The Origin</h1>
  <p>"After meeting in the Cottage Farm Historical District 
    Advanced Technical Bowling League (the CFHDATBL), 
    the members realized they had REAL talent, and quickly began using their 
    penchant for earworms and fascinating melodies. 
    After being endorsed by Richard D. James, 
    they were given 10 Nillion dollars to fund their calling."

<h1>The Band</h1>
<img src="us2.png">
<h3>Mr. Meanor</h3>
<p>Hailing from rural Connecticut, 
    Michael “Mister” Meanor, prides themselves on their 
    deep and supple understanding of the cosmic meta. 
    Having gone to Oxford University for a couple months 
    before mysteriously disappearing, they were found by the 
    Cottage Farm Historical District Advanced Technical Bowling League 
    and quickly taken in for their talents. It is not known how 
    they began their musicianship, but it is clear that the 
    Pryda Snare became their true calling. Using incredibly 
    complicated sound design and electronic performance 
    techniques, “Mr. Meanor” puts on a show to be remembered. 
</p>
    <h3>Brain Johnson</h3>
    <p>Although it is unknown to this day Brain’s origins, 
        his effect on the band is undeniable. 
        Playing the microphone seems to be the easiest way 
        for Brain to express his superior intellect. 
        After being discovered lurking around the Cottage Farm 
        Historical District Advanced Technical Bowling League, 
        his pure brain power alone shocked the other members and 
        blew them away with his perfect performance of “Stronger” 
        by Kanye West. Through his superior mastery of the Microphone, 
        Brain tests the sonic limits of what a Microphone can even do, 
        contributing to the band's inspiring sound. </p>

    <h3>John Timothy David Smithsonian</h3>
      <p>Coming from a hypothetical jazz background, 
        John Timothy David Smithsonian brings a wide array of 
        influences to the 4rd Explorer sound. Having played with a 
        variety of groups such as The 3nd Explorer, 
        Mega-Extreme-Hyper-Ear-Destroyer (needs citation), and 
        Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, Smithsonian provides 
        another layer of musicality to an already incredibly musical 
        and complicated and serious and important and influential and 
        good band. 
    </p>

    <h3>Joe</h3>
        <p>Joe is the greatest musician of all time and 
            has extensive experience playing the oboe for
            well over 3 months. He knew his destiny was to 
            play oboe in the greatest most successful band 
            of all time after realizing that oboe rhymes with 
            Joe. After suffering at least 5 traumatic brain 
            injuries he forgot his last name but he doesn’t care 
            because it’s not important.
